hey there! 

Let's talk about security, starting with the fundamental aspects: Authentication & Authorization.
<br/>
We're going back to the basics!

### Authentication

Before we dive into the details, let's kick off with the ABCs of Authentication: 
- What exactly is authentication? 
- How does it work behind the scenes? 
- And why is it so crucial in the world of application security? 

By grasping these basics, we'll gain the clarity needed to appreciate the more intricate aspects of securing user access and data.

# What is it?

Authentication is the process of validating the identity of an entity (user or system) to ensure it matches the credentials provided before granting access to a protected resource. Think of it like going through customs or immigration at an airport, whether for a domestic or international flight. As a traveler, you must show a form of identification and possibly other documents to prove your identity before being allowed entry into the country.
