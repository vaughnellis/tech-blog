# Contracting  Solutioning

Agenda:
- What a contract is and why they are impt.
- How contracts are structured and who supports the contracting process
- What the common contract templates are and how to apply to direct or indirect engagements
- Avanade's contracting policy (Policy 110)



## What is a Contract
- Easy to understand and reflective of the solution

Definition:
- A voluntary, deliberate, and legally binding agreement between two or more competent parties for the doing or not doing of something specified.

Offer and Acceptance:
- Evidenced by an offer and acceptance of the offer.
    - Concluded once the offering party has been notified of the accepting party's acceptance.

Non-Compliant Acceptance:
- When a party returns with a non-compliant acceptance to the other party's proposal, it is considered a new offer


Contract Structure:
- Master Services Agreement (MSA): terms that will govern future transactions or future agreements between Avanade and the Client.
- Statement of Work (SoW): narrative description of a project's work req incl. project-specific activities, deliverables, and timelines.


Hierarchy Clause
- Defines the relationship and value of the different contractual docs. Standard Avanade contract templates are drafted to enable the SOW to take precedence over the MSA, to allow for any req master terms customization relevant to the specific nature of the solution under nego

Whole Agreement Clause
- Asserts that the entire agreement between parties is contained to the contract and any doc referenced in the contract.
- Seeks to provent the parties from relying on other preceding agreements, nego, or discussions not explicitly stated in the contract.


## Why Is Contracting Important?
- Predictable results req that the solution, financials, and contract stay in balance

- When the solution, financials, and contract get out of balance, the outcome often impacts our ability to deliver the right solution on time and on budget to the Client.


Solution = Financials = Contract

common examples of where the balance gets misaligned include:
1. `Solutioning Assumptions`: Solution development incl. making `Assumptions`, however a Solution Arch must make sure the finance and legal functions are aware of them, and what impact a failed assumption could have on the executio nof the solution in delivery.
2. `Currency & COLA`: To hit a price point, pricing may assume that the Client will cover the impact of changes in currency exchange rates nad cost-of-living adjustments. If that is not also factored in to the Solution and reflected in the contract, the financials can be out of balance.
3. `Warranty & Acceptance`: If the Client nego a warranty term that is much longer than assumed in the Solution, and reflected in the financials, or if the `Acceptance` terms provide the Client additional time to review and call out rework, if this is not factored in the equation gets out of balance.

## Avanade Contracting Templates
    - protect commericial interests, accelerate contracting process, & keep contracting costs at a reasonable level



## Avanade Contract Channels
    - `Direct`
        -   Avanade is accountable for the `solution sold`, and `forms the contractual arrangement` w/ the client.
        - `LOE` (Letter of Engagement) 
            - short form contract for use w/ advisory and/or paper deliverable engagements to help Avanade more rapidly & easily work w/ Clients in the early phases of project, where no existing MSA is in place

    - `Indirect`
        - Accenture is responsible for the `solution sold`, and `own the contractual arrangement` w/ the client. Avanade works through acn under a global intercompany agreement
        

Summary:
1. Avanade Legal Engagement
    - DO is accountable for engaging legal in regard to the proposed Accneture agreement.
2. Accenture Agreement review
    - Legal determines in consultation with DO and ACN if the agreement is suitable for Avanade use, and whether the Agreement can be used as-is or if some items need to be nego w/ the client
3. Avanade Contract Policy approvals
    - Legal w/ support from the DO will draft a summary escalation email to outline any areas of the Agreement that require approval from designated Ava business contacts accountable for key terms under Ava contract policy
