# Commercial Essentials

`Engagement Models` applied to execute the solution have a direct impact on payment and what delivery obligations will apply to the solution.

Commercial Management
- Represents non-tech business disciplines within a company to enable generation of a financial return, particularly the administration of revenue and expenses.
- Return is a promise to deliver both Avanade shareholder margin and Client business value


Essential to effective commercial mgmt:
Maintaining an appropriate balance of risk:
1. `Solution Scope` in respect of Ava req's, Client obligations and areas outside Projects overall sow
2. `Cost of the Solution` incl. resources, expenses, contingency, COLA & FLX and capital charges
3. `Commercial financial terms` under which we sell the Solution, and through which it is defined how Avanade will get paid and how revenue will be recognized.
4. `Contract` that reflects both the obligations for Delivery Execution and the Commercial terms to facilitate payment and Client value realization


Sales Owner

    - Estimate the costs within the appropriate esimtation tool and incorporate into pricing tool (incl. items like resource cost, contingency, expenses, payment terms, etc.)
    - Ensure that the Commercial perspective remains a prio in the face of competing agendas / issues within the solution






# Pricing

Art of establishing what the client should pay for a piece of work.
    - Balancing act between being competitive to win the work while being profitable to support growth

### PRICING MODEL -- PRICING



## Time & Materials 
Resource-based pricing driven by the unit price multiplied by the quantity of resources used
    - Projects of all sizes and scales with ongoing long-term milestones
    - Scope is unknown and flexibility in scope change is expected
    - First time engagements with clients
    - Uncertainty on estiamted effort for completion of scoped work

## Fixed Price
A predetermined price for predetermined deliverable or scope of service
    - Client has a clearly defined scope, aligned to short term goals
    - Client does not want to own the risk of delivery, people and quality
    - Ready to own risks related to scope through change requests

## Transaction Based
Price driven by the unit price of an item multiplied by business transaction volume
    - Transaction volumes are known and predictable
    - Used for business processes which can be clearly defined, measured in discrete units and are standardized, transaction intensive and demand driven
    - Service units can be tied to Ava cost drivers

## As a Service
Pre-integrated service priced on a unit outcome basis "as a Service"
    - Where the clc ient only pays for what they use, thus reducing costs and sharing volume risks
    - Meeting req to provide on demand access and elastic capacity enables faster speed to market
    - Limits the upfront expense typically assoc with standing up IT capabilities

## Subscription Based
Client pays for access or rights to use a service, incl. underlying assets and IP, and their consumption of that service
    - Client pays for access or rights to use a service
    - Prices nad packages shift to align customers usage w/ the value they receive
    - If a tiered pricing approach is necessary based on service provided

## Value Based
Links Ava compensation actual customer value received
    - Fixed and clearly defined outcomes
    - SOW covers elements that driver the specific outcome
    - Output aligning to business process which can be clearly defined, measured in discrete units
    - Clients align service provider goals w/ their business goals


# Commerical Levers

1. Billing and Payment Terms
    - Avoid non-standard or unfavorable billing and payment terms
    - Minimize Peak Capital Balances (PCB)
    - Optimize Client Billing


2. Inflation Risk
incorporate COLA (Cost of Living) protection within our cost model, pricing and contract.

`Contracting Out`: Inc. COLA clause in the contract which passes the risk through the client
`Contract In`: Incl. inflaction projections in the price given to the Client upfront
`Hybrid Solution`: A combination of both contracting out and in, to create a shared risk position


3. Currency Risk
Currency appreciation and depreciation tied to delivery costs known as `Contract Controllable Income` CCI

4. Investment

5. Termination Rights





# Key Takeaways
1. Pricing is a balancing act between competitive to win the work while profitable to support growth
2. Attaining an appropriate balance of risk, must be considered in how we design our solution, how we inted to delivery it and how we expect to manage our costs and get paid
3. Only used a fixed price pricing model when the scope is known. Ensure assumptions and dependencies are clear. Make warranty a pricing issue. Define acceptance gating procedures and signoff
4. Use the ADSP team for handling large complex Direct deals > $4m. Deal teams should engage early and proactively to incorporate terms consideration into solutioning
5. Ensure contract terms reflect a focus and balance on pricing, deliverability, solution, resourcing and payment
