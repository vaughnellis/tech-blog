# Risk Management

Opp and risk come in pairs

Risk can be anything that would adversely impact a project, typically w/ a financial consequence.
Represent a potential for an issue to materialize due to an action/inaction

Common types of risk:
1. Compliance
    - Risks that have the potential to result in violation of a law/regulation, company policy
2. Contract
    - Counterparty will fail to meet the terms of a contract
3. Operational
    - Prospect of loss resulting from inadequate or failed procedures, systems, or policies
4. Financial
    - hampers financial perf, such as exchange rate fluctuations, potential for delayed or non-payment, or overruns in budgeted costs
5. Reputational
    - positive perception others have about a company, or its products and services



Risks that do materialize as issues can be evidenced by:
- Cost overruns
- Client dissatisfaction
- Cancelled projects
- Scheduled delays
- Failure to secure follow-on work
- Damage to company image
- Demoralized staff
- Inadequate functionality
- Legal problems


Successful Risk Management involves `early identification` and a `thorough understanding` of the `likelihood` and `impact of a risk`, in order to determine appropriate actions to `manage` and `mitigate` it.




Ensure risks are understood and properly documented: `Risk statement` and `Risk mitigation`

1. Risk Statement
    - The risk `condition`
        - What will trigger or result in the risk developing into an issue
    - The risk `effect`
        - Impact or consequence of that issue

2. Risk Mitigation
    - The risk `likelihood`
        - Assessment of how likely it is that a risk will develop into an issue
    - The risk `mitigation`
        - Actions that could be taken to reduce the likelihood and impact of the risk



In developing a r isk statement and mitigation plan, it's essential to:
1. Explore options to `contract or transfer away the Risk`
2. Establish suitable actions to `mitigate or manage the risk` rathern than simply adding cost buffer to the solution
3. `Balance risk` in the solution against the potential rewards of a successful engagement
4. `Assess and attain approval` against all financial and operational `consequences` associated to a risk
5. `Manage stakeholder` visibility & understanding of risks

# Quality and Risk Management Program


Opp QA Reviews
    - conducted in pre-sales opp cycle in order to ensure that work can be delivered successfully to meet a client's business need
    
    - must be completed as a pre-req to the Solution Plan (SP051) or the ETA review as part of the proposal process under Client365; and again prior to the final contract approval
    - review outcomes, actions and impact to `Deal Acceptance` must be documented in Quality Review System (QRS) by the assigned Quality Assurance Director (QAD) 


    - used by the DO and SA within the pre-sales phase to help identify risks and establish suitable mitigation plans
    - establishes a Risk score for the opp, which is used to help determine an appropriate level of Solution contingency for the engagement
    
Focus of Opp phase assessment is to review and assess:
    - ALignment of expectation against the proposed commitments
    - Risks are identified and mitigation measures are included
    - alignemtn of the solution w/ client business case and value proposition
    - appropriateness of the deal shape and financials
    - combined risk of hte proposed contractual terms and conditions, as wel as contractual alignment w/  the solution and the client expectations
    - potential for any significant media or political risk arising from the deal


Deal QA Reviews
    - conducted in post mobilization of an awarded contract, and throughout the term fo the delivery engagement

    - QAD will be assigned by the Regional Delivery Executive (RDE), although ideally they will be the same as the QA for the opp review
    - first review in delivery will be performed within 45 days of project start for SI work and by the end of hte transition phase for Application/Infra Outsource (AO/IO) work
    - Further reviews during delivery will be established by the assigned QAD, but are typically quarterly for SI work and every 6 months for AO/IO work

    - used by the Delivery Lead within the delivery phase to assist in identifying risk alignment and action plans to mitigate delivery risk
    - generated based on the output from the Opp QA Risk Assessment

Focus of a Delivery phase assessment is to review and assess:
    - alignment of expectaitons w/ the contractual commitments
    - adherence to the contractual commitments
    - steps taken to identify, monitor and mitigate risks
    - timely resolution of project risks and issues, and chievement of committed business outcomes
    - the existence and effectiveness of internal controls being in place on the project
    - whether financial projections for both near and long term are reasonable and accurate

## Solution Contingency
Component of the `overall cost estimation` for the Solution where cost is forecast to `support the mitigation of the identified risks` materializing within the delivery.
Established during opp phase to be managed through Delivery phase. Intended to cover costs when a specific project risks materialize which could not be mitigated.

How we determine Risk Contingency:
Risk that cna be tangible aligned to the ability to deliver the solution

1. availability issues of defined resources or role levels
2. rework of required delivery tasks due to quality or perf issues
3. uncertainty linked to new, or unfamiliar, technology, applications or processes.



How do use:
- `Contingency Funds` should be allocated to a specific risk
    - If that risk is not realized, the amount assoc to that `risk provision` should be released during delivery to support margin enhancement

Examples of risks where solution is applied:
1. Resources unavailable when required or with the risk skills
2. Tasks need to be redone or repeated due to quality issues
3. Uncertainty linked to new technology or applications
4. Estimating assumptions prove incorrect
5. Additional/required non-billable work effort
