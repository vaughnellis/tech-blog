## Requirements Management (RM) (Final Phase) (Sits in the Center)
- Constant technique to handle changes
- Continuous process of handling change during any phase of the ADM process
- Being able to handle change at any time is crucial for the ADM to succeed

Purpose:
- ensure the process if sustained through all phases (Ability to handle change)
- manage change while the ADM cycle is in progress
- provide the req to each ADM phase
- manage the flow of req

RM - process that manages the arch repo


## ADM Guidelines and Tools
1. Arch principles
2. Stakeholder Management
3. Arch Patterns
4. Gap Analysis
5. Migration Planning Techniques
6. Interoperability Req
7. Business Transformation Readiness Assessment
8. Risk Management
9. Arch Alternatives and Trade-Offs


## Architecture Principles
- Enduring set of general rules and guidelines about architecture
- Defined during the Preliminary Phase
    - Serves as a statement by which you can use to make decisions

Example:
    Data Arch Principle
        - Data trustee
            - Each data element has a trustee accountable for data quality

TOGAF Specs: Five Elements of a Good Principle
    1. Understandability - easy to understand what the principle is talking about. Intention/Wording is clear. No grey area
    2. Robustness - Each principle should be definitive and precise.
    3. Completeness - every impt principle should cover every potential situation
    4. Consistency 
    5. Stability 



## Stakeholder Management
    - "An individual, team, organization, or class thereof, having an interest in a system"
    - As an architect, being able to win support for your plans is a skill.
        - Knowing who the most powerful stakeholders are...
        - Makes things easier for approval and budgets
        - Can establish a comms plan to keep them informed
        - Identify problems and conflicts early in order to avoid them.

    - how you deal with the various stakeholders of a project actually contributes to the success or failure of the project.
    - Effectively like politics or the way that you handle certain people

        High        (C) Keep Satisfied          (D) Key Players 
Power   Low         (A) Minimal Effort          (B) Keep Informed
                            Low                         High
                                    Level of Interest




## Architecture Patterns
    - An idea that has been useful in one practical context and will probably be useful in others
        M. Fowler
    
    - when, why, and how you use (ABBs, SBBs)
     


## Gap Analysis
    - Key step in the BDAT Phases and MIgration Planning (Phase B-E)
    - Baseline Arch - arch that currently exists
    - Target Arch - desired destination

    - Gaps are anything asdded, changed or intentionally omitted
    - Identify things accidentally omitted

    - Should be clear and easy to explain why things were added or removed


## Migration Planning Tecnique (Phase F)
1. Implementation Factor Assessment & Deduction Matrix
2. Consolidated Gaps, Solutions & Dependencies Matrix
3. Architecture Definition Increments Table
4. Transition Architecture State Evolution Table
5. Business Value Assessment Technique


Implementation Factor Catalog:

Factors typically include:
1. Risks
2. Issues
3. Assumptions
4. Dependencies
5. Actions
6. Impacts


Consolidated Gaps, Solutions, & Dependencies Matrix
    - Gaps identified during phase B, C, and D.
    - Can be used as a planning tool when creating work packages.
    - Work packages identified during phase E and F.


Arch Definition Increments Table
    - allows the architect to plan a series of Transition Arch
    - Lists the projects and then assigning their incremental deliverables across the Transition arch


Transition Arch State Evolution Table
    - show the proposed state of the arch at various levels
    - at a glance, anyone can see that after Phase 1 of implem, the new services that will be available even if they are not fully transitioned to the final target arch yet.
    - Can also use a color coding matrix, with green, yellow, and red showing the state of various s ervices after each transition arch is implemented

Business Value Assessment Technique
    - A technique to assess business value based on risk versus value
    - at a glance way to see the status of the overall  implem project on the overall arch implem value
    - Some projects that are at risk might be low value, which is better than high value projects being at risk



## Interoperability Requirements
    - ability to share information and services
    - Business Interoperability: how business teams work together
    - Information Interop: how data is shared
    - Technical Interop: how technical services connect to one another
    

## Business Transformation Readiness Assessment (BTRA)
    - Evaluating and quantifying an org's readiness to undergo change
    - no point creating arch if it'll be ignored
    - Understanding how to get your org to change is a key to success


Main Steps (Recommended Activities for BTRA)
1. Determine the readiness factors that will impact the org
    Example Factors:
        - Vision
        - Desire, Willingness, Resolve
        - Need
        - Business Case
        - Funding
        - Leadership, Sponsor, Champion
        - Governance
        - Accountability
        - IT Capacity to Execute
        -Enterprise Capacity to Execute
2. Present the readiness factors using maturity models
3. Assess the readiness factors, including determination of readiness factor ratings
4. Assess the risks for each readiness factor and identify improvement actions to mitigate the risk
5. Work these actions into Phase E and F implementation and Migration Plan



## Risk Management
    - What are the risks of migrating to the target arch?
    - Identify and Track

Two Levels:
1. Initial Level of Risk
    - the risk that exists if you do nothing to mitigate
2. Residual Level of Risk
    - the risk that remains after you have mitigated

Example: Client acceptance risk
How do you measure it?
How do you mitigate it?
And what would the cost to the business be if it comes true?



## Architecture Alternatives and Trade-Offs
    - a technique to identify alternative Target Arch and perform trade-offs between the alternatives

    - more than one target arch can fulfill the arch vision
    - choosing which arch to use is a matter of trade-offs

Trade-offs:
1. Flexibility
2. Time and cost
3. Length of time to achieve benefits
4. Adherence to arch guidelines
5. Solution delivery method (develop, buy)
6. Impact on business capabilities
7. Risk



## Architecture Governance
- A system of management and controls over arch
- A system to ensure ongoing compliance with arch

Effective management of those system

Why do this?
- Accountability to the business


Governance is layered within  most org
    Domains:
    - Corporate governance - Executive team
    - Technology governance 
    - IT governance
    - Arch governance


Principles of Good Governance:
1. Discipline
2. Transparency
3. Independence
4. Accountability
5. Responsibility
6. Fairness


## Architecture Board
- Representative of all the key stakeholders in the arch



## Architecture Contracts
- joint agreements between development partners and sponsors on the deliverables, quality, and fitness-for-purpose of an arch

Contracts usually cover:
    - Continuous monitoring for compliance
    - Adherence to principles, standards, and req
    - Identification of risks
    - Accountability, responsibility, and discipline
    - A formal understanding of the governance organization


## Architecture Compliance
- Judge whether an implementation matches the req that have been outlined
    - Formal process of making sure that what's been implemented matches the expectation

- Irrelevant (N/A)
    - no features in common with the arch specs
- Consistent
    - some features in common with the arch specs and the features that were implemented are actually in conformance with the specs
    - everything that was implemented matches the specs but not everything was implemented
- Compliant
    - some features of the spces are not implemented but all of the features implemented were in the specs
- Conformant (did more of what was asked for)
    - all the features in the specs were implemented and are good but more features were implemented that are not covered by the specs
- Fully conformant
    - 100% match between what was implemented and what was asked
- Non-conformant 
    - implemented features not according to the req




## Practice Test

### Definitions
1. According to the TOGAF 10 Standard, when going through the ADM and performing a Gap Analysis, what is a "gap"?
    - ***A difference between the baseline and target architectures***
        - Explanation: In the context of the TOGAF 10 ADM, a "gap" refers to a difference or discrepancy between the existing (baseline) architecture and the desired (target) architecture. Gap Analysis is a technique for identifying what needs to change in terms of components, processes, and other factors to move from the current state to the desired future state. "A missing software tool or application within the enterprise's IT landscape" is incorrect because, while missing tools or applications might be discovered as a result of a Gap Analysis, they do not define what a gap is. "The lack of alignment between the business and IT strategies" is a broader strategic concern that might lead to an architectural gap, but it doesn't define a gap within the context of the ADM. "An architectural decision that hasn't been approved by stakeholders" is unrelated to the concept of a gap in this context; it deals more with architectural governance and stakeholder approval.
2. According to the TOGAF 10 Standard, which of the following best describes architecture governance?
    - ***The practice of monitoring and directing architecture activities to ensure alignment with business objectives.***
        - Explanation: Architecture governance in the TOGAF 10 context refers to the overarching practice of overseeing, directing, and ensuring that architectural initiatives and activities are in alignment with the organization's business objectives and strategies. It encompasses principles, practices, roles, responsibilities, and processes that ensure the effective and efficient use of architecture resources in achieving desired outcomes. "The structure and hierarchy of roles within an architectural team" is not correct because it focuses on roles, not on the overall monitoring and guiding function of governance. "The software and tools used in the architectural development process" is off the mark as it emphasizes tools rather than governance processes. "The blueprint or design of an organization's technology systems", while related to architectural work, is not governance itself but rather a product of architectural efforts.
3. According to the TOGAF 10 Standard, which of the following best describes the enterprise continuum?
    - ***A classification scheme for architecture assets.***
        - Explanation: The Enterprise Continuum in TOGAF 10 provides a classification scheme for categorizing and storing architecture and solution assets. It serves as a valuable tool for developing architectures across an organization by helping architects understand where and how specific assets fit within a broader architectural context. "A repository for storing architecture artifacts" is incorrect because the Enterprise Continuum is not a repository but a classification model; the Architecture Repository is where artifacts are stored. "A lifecycle method for developing architectures" is incorrect as this describes the Architecture Development Method (ADM), not the Enterprise Continuum. "A set of predefined architecture patterns" is not entirely accurate because while the continuum does include patterns, it's not merely a set of predefined patterns; it's a broader classification scheme.
4. According to the TOGAF 10 Standard, which of the following is an architectural work product that describes an aspect of the architecture?
    - ***Artifact***
        - Explanation: In the TOGAF 10 framework, an "Artifact" is an architectural work product that describes an aspect of the architecture. Artifacts represent specific pieces of information that are produced, consumed, or utilized during the architectural process. "Transition Architecture", represents a state of the architecture at a significant milestone. "Viewpoint", is the specification of the conventions for constructing and using a view. It provides the template from which a view can be developed. "Stakeholder", refers to individuals or entities that have interests in, or concerns relative to, the outcome of the architecture. Among these choices, only "Artifact" correctly identifies an architectural work product that captures and documents an aspect of the architecture.
5. Which statement best describes a building block?
    - ***A potentially re-usable component that can be combined with other building blocks to deliver architectures and solutions.***
        - Explanation: In the TOGAF 10 framework, a "Building Block" represents a potentially re-usable component (whether functional, technical, or organizational) that can be combined with other building blocks to form complete architectures or solutions. "A complete solution for enterprise architecture requirements" describes a result, but not the fundamental nature of a building block. "A standalone unit that doesn't interact with other components" is incorrect as building blocks are designed to interact with others to form a complete system or solution. "The process of defining and documenting the structure, organization, and implementation of architectural components" describes the process of architecture work, not the definition of a building block. Among the choices, only "A potentially re-usable component that can be combined with other building blocks to deliver architectures and solutions" accurately captures the essence of what a building block represents within the TOGAF framework.
6. According to the TOGAF 10 Standard, which of the following best describes an enterprise?
    - ***Any collection of organizations that share a common set of goals.***
        - Explanation: In the context of TOGAF 10, an "enterprise" is broadly defined as any collection of organizations that share a common set of goals. This could be a single organization or a cross-section of multiple organizations. The emphasis is on the shared objectives rather than the size or nature of the entity. "A large multinational corporation with thousands of employees" is incorrect as an enterprise does not necessarily have to be large or multinational. "A formal structure with a primary goal of producing profits for its shareholders" is overly narrow, as enterprises can have various goals beyond profit-making. "A technological infrastructure that supports business operations" misconstrues the term "enterprise" by focusing on the technological aspect rather than the collective organizational goals.
7. According to the TOGAF 10 Standard, which of the following is a description of the future state of the architecture being developed for an organization?
    - ***Target Architecture***
        - Explanation: In the TOGAF 10 framework, the "Target Architecture" describes the desired or future state of the architecture that an organization aims to achieve. It contrasts with the "Baseline Architecture", which describes the current or existing state. The process of moving from the Baseline to the Target Architecture often involves identifying gaps and creating a roadmap. "Baseline Architecture", describes the current state, not the future state. The "Architecture Repository", is a storage space for architectural artifacts and not a description of the future state itself. "Architecture Landscape", provides an overview of the entire architecture environment but isn't specifically focused on the future state alone.
8. According to the TOGAF 10 Standard, which of the following describes one state of the architecture at an architecturally significant point in time?
    - ***Transition Architecture***
        - Explanation: In the TOGAF 10 framework, "Transition Architecture" describes the architecture of a solution at an interim, architecturally significant milestone as the enterprise progresses from the Baseline Architecture to the Target Architecture. It provides a clear view and roadmap of the architectural landscape's evolution. "Baseline Architecture", describes the current state of the architecture. "Target Architecture", represents the desired or future state of the architecture. "Architecture Vision", is the high-level, aspirational view of the end architecture product. Among the given options, only the Transition Architecture captures the description of the architecture at a specific, significant point during its evolution towards the desired future state.
9. Which of the following terms means a representation of a system from the perspective of a related set of concerns?
    - ***View***
        - Explanation: In the TOGAF 10 framework, a "View" is defined as a representation of a system from the perspective of a related set of concerns. It's essentially what you see when you look at a system from a particular viewpoint. "Viewpoint", is the specification of the conventions for constructing and using a view. It defines the perspective and the concerns addressed, but is not the representation itself. "Stakeholder", refers to an individual, team, or organization (or classes thereof) with interests in, or concerns relative to, the outcome of the architecture. "Artifact", is a more general term representing a tangible output of the architectural work, which might be a document, model, or other specific form of output. Among these options, only "View" accurately captures the representation of the system based on a set of concerns.
10. According to the TOGAF 10 Standard, which of the following is an architectural work product that is contractually specified and formally reviewed, agreed, and signed off by the stakeholders?
    - ***Architecture Contract***
        - Explanation: In TOGAF 10, an "Architecture Contract" is the joint agreement between architecture practitioners and stakeholders. It is contractually specified and details the deliverables, artifacts, and responsibilities of the parties involved. Once established, the Architecture Contract is formally reviewed, agreed upon, and signed off by the stakeholders. The "Architecture Principle", provides the general rules and guidelines for architecture work but isn't a contractually binding document. The "Architecture Vision", sets the high-level direction and initial descriptions of an architecture initiative but does not serve as a contractual agreement. "Architecture Building Block (ABB)", represents a component of the architecture model, but it isn't a signed-off contract between parties.






### ADM
1. Which phase of the ADM primarily focuses on defining the architecture for the technology platforms, realizing the building blocks, and ensuring alignment with the business?
    - ***Phase D***
        - Explanation: In the TOGAF 10 framework, "Phase D" pertains to the Technology Architecture. The main objective during this phase is to design the technological infrastructure needed to support the deployment of core applications, data, and processes. It involves detailing the technology solutions and platforms, defining building blocks, and ensuring that the technology architecture is consistent and aligned with the business requirements. While "Phase A" addresses the overall architecture vision, "Phase B" delves into Business Architecture, and "Phase C" deals with Data and Application Architecture. Among the options provided, only "Phase D" specifically focuses on the Technology Architecture.
2. Which phase of the ADM is responsible for ongoing management and enhancement of the architecture to ensure it remains relevant and effective against the original business objectives?
    - ***Phase H***
        - Explanation: In the TOGAF 10 framework, "Phase H" is named Architecture Change Management. Its main purpose is to ensure the architecture remains consistent and relevant in the face of changing business needs and environments. It manages and enhances the established architecture over time to maintain its alignment with business objectives. While the other phases have crucial roles within the ADM cycle, "Phase E" is focused on Opportunities and Solutions, "Phase F" on Migration Planning, and "Phase G" on Implementation Governance. Only "Phase H" emphasizes the continual monitoring and management of the architecture after it has been established.
3. Which phase of the ADM primarily emphasizes overseeing the implementation of the architecture projects to ensure they are executed in alignment with the defined architecture?
    - ***Phase G***
        - Explanation: In the TOGAF 10 framework, "Phase G" is known as Implementation Governance. During this phase, the main focus is on providing architectural oversight for the implementation. This ensures that projects are carried out in compliance with the defined architecture, ensuring that any deviations are handled appropriately. "Phase E" deals with Opportunities and Solutions, "Phase F" revolves around Migration Planning, and "Phase H" tackles Architecture Change Management. Out of the given options, only "Phase G" is specifically centered on governance during the implementation of the architecture projects.
4. Of the four stakeholders listed below, which stakeholder is MOST LIKELY to be interested in the output of Phase D of the ADM?
    - ***Head of the IT Department***
        - Explanation: Phase D of the ADM in TOGAF 10 pertains to the Technology Architecture. This phase aims to map out and define the technology infrastructure, platforms, and software necessary to support the enterprise's architecture. It entails designing the hardware, software, and network solutions to meet the application and data requirements of the organization. As a result, the Head of the IT Department would have a significant interest in the outputs of this phase, as they are responsible for overseeing the technology infrastructure, its acquisition, and its effective deployment. While the other options – Chief Marketing Officer, Head of Human Resources, and Chief Financial Officer – would have some interest in various aspects of the enterprise's architecture, they would not be as directly concerned with the technical details laid out in Phase D as the Head of the IT Department would be.
5. In which phase of the ADM might you find a “Product Lifecycle Diagram” as possibly one of the artifacts created?
    - ***Phase B***
        - Explanation: The "Product Lifecycle Diagram" is typically associated with the business domain, focusing on how products evolve, get developed, and retire over time. This is a key consideration in defining the business strategy and operations, making it most relevant in "Phase B: Business Architecture" of the ADM. In Phase B, the organization's business strategy, governance, organization, and key business processes are defined and analyzed. As such, a Product Lifecycle Diagram can be a useful artifact to represent part of the business process landscape and product strategy. The other options are not primarily focused on the detailed development and representation of business strategies and processes.
6. In which phase of the ADM might you find an “Application Use-Case Diagram” as possibly one of the artifacts created?
    - ***Phase C***
        - Explanation: The "Phase C: Application Architecture" of the ADM specifically addresses the development of the Application Architecture for an organization, including the identification and articulation of key application components and their relationships. An Application Use-Case Diagram is a type of artifact that showcases how different application components interact or are used to achieve specific functions or tasks. This makes it highly relevant to Phase C, which is about defining applications and their interactions. Phase A focuses on the Architecture Vision, Phase B is dedicated to Business Architecture, and Phase D centers on Technology Architecture. Consequently, among the options provided, only Phase C would typically involve the creation of an Application Use-Case Diagram as part of its architectural artifacts.
7. Which of the following best describes the primary purpose of the TOGAF Architecture Development Method (ADM)?
    - ***Providing a detailed step-by-step approach for developing an enterprise architecture.***
        - Explanation: The TOGAF Architecture Development Method (ADM) serves as the core of TOGAF. Its primary objective is to provide a detailed, step-by-step approach for developing an enterprise architecture, ensuring that all aspects of the enterprise are addressed and integrated into a holistic view. "Defining a long-term IT strategy for an organization", while somewhat related, is too narrow in its focus on IT and does not encompass the breadth and depth of enterprise architecture as defined by TOGAF. "Implementing agile development processes within an organization" is incorrect because the ADM is not specifically about agile development processes; it's about the overall development of an enterprise architecture. "Designing the interface layouts for software applications" is off-topic; interface layouts for software applications are far more specific and granular than what the ADM intends to address.
8. In which phase of the ADM is the "Statement of Architecture Work" developed and approved by sponsors?
    - ***Phase A***
        - Explanation: In the TOGAF 10 framework, the "Statement of Architecture Work" is developed and approved during "Phase A: Architecture Vision". This statement details the scope, approach, and content of an architecture development activity. It serves as a reference throughout the enterprise architecture process. While the Preliminary Phase deals with the preparation and initiation of the ADM cycle, including tailoring the framework and defining principles, it is in Phase A where the Statement of Architecture Work is defined and agreed upon by stakeholders, especially the sponsors.
9. Which phase of the ADM has the objective to determine the architecture capability desired by the organization?
    - ***Preliminary Phase***
        - Explanation: In the TOGAF 10 framework, the "Preliminary Phase" focuses on defining the enterprise's architecture vision and strategy, which includes determining the desired architecture capability. This phase establishes how an organization's architecture capability will meet the strategic objectives of the enterprise. Phase A is more about defining the high-level strategic intent of the entire architecture development. Phase B describes the current and future state of the business environment. Phase D defines the technology infrastructure needed to support the other architecture domains. Among the provided choices, only the Preliminary Phase captures the objective of determining the desired architecture capability of the organization.
10. In which phase of the ADM are the Baseline and Target Application Architectures developed?
    - ***Phase C***
        - Explanation: In the ADM, "Phase C: Application Architecture" is specifically focused on defining the applications that are necessary to support the business functions and processes, both for the current (Baseline) and the desired future (Target) states. During this phase, the Application Architecture provides a blueprint for the individual application systems to be deployed, their interactions, and their relationships to the core business processes. The other phases listed are dedicated to different facets of the enterprise architecture: Phase A addresses the Architecture Vision, Phase B focuses on Business Architecture, and Phase D is for the Technology Architecture. Hence, only Phase C is directly concerned with the development of both the Baseline and Target Application Architectures.
11. Which phase of the ADM is primarily concerned with creating detailed plans to guide the implementation of the Target Architecture?
    - ***Phase F***
        - Explanation: In the TOGAF 10 framework, "Phase F" relates to Migration Planning. This phase primarily focuses on crafting detailed plans that guide the enterprise through the implementation of the Target Architecture. The Migration Plan is developed in this phase, detailing the projects, their dependencies, and timelines required to achieve the full transformation. While "Phase E" identifies opportunities and solutions for transitioning, "Phase G" deals with implementation governance, and "Phase H" is concerned with architecture change management. Among the choices, only "Phase F" emphasizes the detailed planning for the transition from the Baseline to the Target Architectures.
12. In TOGAF 10, which phase focuses on creating an initial architecture vision and obtaining stakeholder buy-in?
    - ***Phase A***
        - Explanation: Phase A, known as "Architecture Vision" in TOGAF, is the correct answer. This phase is the initial phase of the TOGAF ADM and is specifically dedicated to creating an initial architectural vision that outlines the high-level scope, objectives, and stakeholders' concerns for the architecture project. It plays a crucial role in obtaining stakeholder buy-in and ensuring that all stakeholders have a common understanding of the architecture project's goals and objectives. Phases B, C, and D represent different phases in the TOGAF ADM, but they do not focus on the creation of the initial architecture vision and stakeholder buy-in, making them incorrect answers for this question.
13. Which phase of the ADM has the objective to define the data structures, relationships, applications, and technology required to support the enterprise?
    - ***Phase C***
        - Explanation: In the TOGAF 10 framework, "Phase C" is split into two parts: Data Architecture and Application Architecture. When focusing on Data Architecture, the primary objective is to define the data structures, relationships, and their specifications. This includes understanding the data assets of the organization, their relationships, and the associated data standards and principles. "Phase A" provides the overarching architecture vision, "Phase B" is dedicated to Business Architecture, and the "Preliminary Phase" prepares the organization to undertake architecture development. Among these options, only "Phase C" zeroes in on defining data architectures and its related components.
14. Which phase of the ADM has the objective to obtain approval for a Statement of Architecture Work?
    - ***Phase A***
        - Explanation: In the TOGAF 10 framework, "Phase A" is titled "Architecture Vision." This phase is primarily concerned with the creation of the Statement of Architecture Work, which captures the scope, approach, and content of the architecture activities being undertaken. A crucial step within this phase is obtaining the necessary approvals to commence further work based on this statement. In contrast, the "Preliminary Phase" focuses on establishing the architecture capability, "Phase B" is about developing the business architecture, and "Phase D" deals with the technology architecture. Among the options, only "Phase A" specifically aims at obtaining approval for the Statement of Architecture Work.
15. Which phase of the ADM ensures that the architecture responds appropriately to both the needs of the business and the evolving project requirements?
    - ***Requirements Management Phase***
        - Explanation: In the TOGAF 10 framework, the "Requirements Management Phase" acts as a central hub that governs the flow of requirements to and from the various phases of the ADM. It ensures that the architecture remains consistently aligned with business needs throughout its lifecycle. The phase manages and addresses requirements as they are identified, throughout the architecture development cycle. While other phases such as "Phase A", "Phase H", and "Phase F" have important roles in the ADM process, it is the Requirements Management Phase that is specifically dedicated to overseeing and managing requirements in a holistic manner.
16. In which phase of the ADM is the "Draft Architecture Definition Document" created, which may include draft baseline and target architectures?
    - ***Phase A***
        - Explanation: In the TOGAF 10 framework, the "Draft Architecture Definition Document" is created during "Phase A: Architecture Vision". This document provides a description of the new architecture as a series of views addressing stakeholder concerns, thus capturing both the baseline (current) and target (desired) architectural states. Phase A focuses on creating the high-level vision of the capabilities and business value to be delivered as a result of the proposed enterprise architecture. The other phases further refine or implement parts of the architecture, but it is Phase A where the initial draft of the Architecture Definition Document is established.
17. Which phase of the ADM has the objective to describe the structure and interaction of the primary applications and data necessary to meet the organization's objectives?
    - ***Phase C***
        - Explanation: In the TOGAF 10 framework, "Phase C" encompasses both Data Architecture and Application Architecture. When focusing on Application Architecture, the primary objective is to establish a blueprint for the individual application systems to be deployed, the interactions between application systems, and their relationships to the core business processes of the organization. "Phase A" provides the overarching architecture vision, "Phase B" concentrates on Business Architecture, and the "Preliminary Phase" sets the groundwork for the architecture development effort. Among the provided choices, only "Phase C" specifically addresses the development and description of the Application Architecture.
18. Which phase of the ADM has the objective to develop the Target Business Architecture?
    - ***Phase B***
        - Explanation: In the TOGAF 10 framework, "Phase B" is dedicated to Business Architecture. The main objective of this phase is to develop the Target Business Architecture that describes how the enterprise will operate in the future, given the desired architecture outcome. This phase looks into the organizational structure, governance, business processes, and operations of the enterprise. On the other hand, "Phase A" (Architecture Vision) sets the overall vision for the architectural endeavor, "Phase C" delves into Information Systems Architectures, and the "Preliminary Phase" prepares the organization for undertaking an architecture project. Of all these phases, only "Phase B" focuses specifically on the development of the Target Business Architecture.
19. In which phase of the ADM is the TOGAF architecture framework first tailored to meet the business need?
    - ***Preliminary Phase***
        - Explanation: In the TOGAF 10 framework, the "Preliminary Phase" is the phase where the TOGAF Architecture Framework is customized and tailored to align with the enterprise's specific needs, capabilities, constraints, and the existing environment. It sets the foundation by establishing the architecture team, tools, principles, and governance structures that will guide subsequent phases. While "Phase A", "Phase B", and "Phase C" involve important activities related to understanding business needs, establishing architecture visions, and detailing specific architecture domains, it is the Preliminary Phase that is specifically dedicated to tailoring the framework to meet the enterprise's unique context.
20. In which phase of the ADM are the Baseline and Target Business Architectures developed?
    - ***Phase B***
        - Explanation: In the TOGAF 10 framework, the Baseline and Target Business Architectures are developed during "Phase B: Business Architecture". This phase focuses on describing the existing business architecture (baseline) and establishing the future business architecture (target) that the organization aims to achieve. The goal is to represent organizational, functional, process, information, and other related architectures in both current and desired future states. While Phase A (Architecture Vision) sets the high-level strategic context, it is in Phase B where the detailed business architectures are defined. The other options do not specifically focus on the detailed development of business architectures.
21. In which phase of the ADM is the “Request for Architecture Work (optional)” created?
    - ***Preliminary Phase***
        - Explanation: In the TOGAF 10 framework, the "Request for Architecture Work" is an optional artifact that can be produced during the "Preliminary Phase". This request provides a justification for starting a new architecture project cycle and defines the sponsor's requirements and constraints. It might originate from the business strategy, enterprise planning, portfolio management, or another source. While other phases in the ADM process focus on defining and detailing architecture vision, business architecture, and other domains, it is the Preliminary Phase where foundational steps such as creating the “Request for Architecture Work” take place to kickstart the architecture activity.
22. In the TOGAF 10 Architecture Development Method (ADM), what is a primary objective of the Preliminary Phase?
    - ***To define the scope of the architecture capability.***
        - Explanation: The Preliminary Phase in the TOGAF ADM primarily deals with preparing and setting up the architecture capability in an organization. It defines the scope, establishes the necessary architecture principles and practices, and prepares the organization to undergo a structured and systematic architecture development process. "To develop the target architecture" is incorrect because the development of the target architecture typically occurs in later phases. "To determine technology solutions for the organization" is also inaccurate because determining technology solutions is part of translating architectural decisions and is not the primary objective of the Preliminary Phase. "To select reference models, viewpoints, and tools", while an activity in the Preliminary Phase, does not capture the overarching objective of the phase as effectively as "To define the scope of the architecture capability" does.
23. Which phase of the ADM primarily concentrates on formulating the implementation and migration strategies, encompassing the transition from the Baseline to the Target Architectures?
    - ***Phase E***
        - Explanation: In the TOGAF 10 framework, "Phase E" pertains to the Opportunities & Solutions. During this phase, the emphasis is on identifying major implementation projects and initiatives required to transition from the current, or Baseline Architecture, to the desired, or Target Architecture. It involves evaluating and prioritizing the projects based on criteria such as return on investment, alignment with business strategy, and technical feasibility. While "Phase C" and "Phase D" are more focused on defining the Data, Application, and Technology Architectures respectively, "Phase F" proceeds with migration planning details after opportunities and solutions have been identified. Among the options provided, only "Phase E" specifically focuses on detailing opportunities and solutions for the migration.

### ADM Techniques
1. Some organizations choose to go through Phases B-D of the ADM lightly, and then go back over Phases B-D again with more detail instead of doing them completely in order. What is this an example of?
    - ***Iteration***
        - Explanation: Iteration refers to the practice of repeating certain phases or activities within the ADM to refine and detail the architecture as it evolves. In this case, organizations are taking an iterative approach to Phases B-D to gain a broader, high-level perspective before diving deeper into the specifics during the next pass. Iteration ensures that architects can adapt to changes or additional information, making the final architecture more aligned with the requirements. The other options, segmentation, diversification, and modularization, do not accurately describe the practice of revisiting phases for refinement and depth.
2. Which ADM guideline and technique is primarily used to assess if an organization is prepared to embrace significant changes?
    - ***Business Transformation Readiness Assessment***
        - Explanation: The Business Transformation Readiness Assessment is a key ADM guideline and technique for evaluating an organization's readiness to effectively adopt significant changes, especially in the context of business transformation efforts. It helps determine whether the organization possesses the necessary capabilities, resources, and willingness to successfully implement proposed changes. While other techniques such as Capability-Based Planning, Gap Analysis, and Stakeholder Management are valuable in the ADM process, they do not specifically focus on assessing an organization's readiness for change, making BTRA the most appropriate choice for this question.
3. You are the chief architect for GetCloudSkills. (Congratulations!) You have adopted the architecture principle that "data is an asset." How often should you review this principle to see if it's still valid and possibly change it?
    - ***At least annually***
        - Explanation: Architecture principles are intended to be enduring, but they should not be immutable. Regular reviews ensure they remain aligned with the organization's mission, strategy, and evolving context. While the exact frequency of review might vary based on the organization's size, culture, and industry, a common best practice is to review architecture principles at least annually. This ensures that they remain relevant in a changing business environment. "Every time a new project starts" is too frequent, making it difficult to maintain a consistent architectural vision. "Only when there is a significant change in the organization's strategy" is too infrequent, as waiting for a significant strategic change might mean missing out on other relevant changes or nuances. "Once it has been set, it should not be changed" contradicts the evolving nature of business and technology environments.
4. You are the chief architect for GetCloudSkills, a company that has tens of thousands of employees across several countries. You are designing a communication plan for stakeholders. The CEO of the company is obviously an important person to keep happy but is not personally involved in the day-to-day business at the ground level. Where does he fit on the stakeholder map?
    - ***Low Interest, High Power***
        - Explanation: In the stakeholder map or Power Interest Matrix, stakeholders are classified based on their level of interest (concern) and their power (influence) over the project or initiative. The CEO of the company, while not directly involved in day-to-day operations, typically holds significant power due to their position as the company's leader. However, their level of interest in the detailed, day-to-day activities may be relatively low. Therefore, the CEO would typically be categorized as "Low Interest, High Power," meaning they need to be kept satisfied and informed about key developments but may not require detailed involvement or frequent communication on operational matters. The other options do not accurately reflect the typical role of a CEO in the stakeholder map.


### Core
1. According to the TOGAF 10 Standard, which of the following techniques is the core of the TOGAF Framework?
    - ***Architecture Development Method (ADM)***
        - Explanation: The Architecture Development Method (ADM) is the heart of the TOGAF framework. It provides a tested and repeatable process for developing architectures. ADM is a comprehensive, step-by-step approach to guide architects through the complex process of enterprise architecture development. While the other options (Enterprise Continuum, Architecture Capability Framework, and Architecture Repository) are essential components of the TOGAF framework, none of them individually represent the core technique of TOGAF in the same way that the ADM does. The ADM integrates all these components and provides the methodology for creating and using enterprise architectures.

## Enterprise Continuum
1. Which of the following is the best example of an asset that might exist in the organization-specific category of the Architecture Continuum?
    - ***A tailored CRM system for ABC Corp's unique processes***
        - Explanation: The Architecture Continuum in TOGAF is divided into categories that range from foundational to specific. The "organization-specific" category encompasses architectures tailored to a particular organization's unique needs and context. A tailored CRM system for ABC Corp's unique processes falls under this category, as it is specifically designed for that organization's operations. In contrast, general industry best practices, generic security protocols, and standardized infrastructure components are more generic and would fit earlier in the continuum, being relevant to a broader range of organizations.
2. If you look at the scale of the Architecture Continuum, what is the name of the left-most category?
     - ***Foundation Architectures***
        - Explanation: The Architecture Continuum in TOGAF provides a progression of architecture assets that move from foundational to more specific. At the left-most end of the scale, "Foundation Architectures" provide the most generic, foundational building blocks and standards that can be used across various industries and organizations. They are the base upon which more specific architectures are built. The other options—Common Systems Architectures, Industry Architectures, and Organization-Specific Architectures—progressively move to the right, becoming more specific and tailored.


# PRACTICE TESTS
1. Which statement about Requirements Management is most correct?
- ***Requirements Management and stakeholder engagement are placed at the center of architecture development.***

2. Which of the following best describes the class of information known as the Reference Library within the Architecture Repository?
- ***Guidelines and templates used to create new architectures***

3. Which of the following describes how the Enterprise Continuum is used when developing an enterprise architecture?
- ***To classify architecture and solution assets***

4. What is used to structure architectural information in an orderly way so that it can be processed to meet stakeholder needs?
-  ***A Content Metamodel***

5. Which of the following is a responsibility of an Architecture Board? 
- ***Establishing targets for re-use of components***
    - Explanation: An Architecture Board is an executive-level group responsible for the review and maintenance of the strategic architecture and all of its sub-architectures. It is a key element in a successful Architecture Governance strategy.
    An Architecture Board is typically made responsible, and accountable, for achieving some or all of the following goals:

    Providing the basis for all decision-making with regard to the architectures 
    Consistency between sub-architectures 
    Establishing targets for re-use of components 
    Flexibility of the Enterprise Architecture: To meet changing business needs 
    To leverage new technologies

    Enforcement of Architecture Compliance 

    Improving the maturity level of architecture discipline within the organization 
    Ensuring that the discipline of architecture-based development is adopted 
    Supporting a visible escalation capability for out-of-bounds decisions 
    Therefore, the correct answer is option D, which captures one of the goals of an Architecture Board as stated in the TOGAF Standard, Version 9.22. Option A is incorrect, because conducting assessments of the maturity level of architecture discipline within the organization is not a direct responsibility of an Architecture Board, but rather a part of the Architecture Capability Framework3. Option B is incorrect, because allocating resources for architecture projects is not a direct responsibility of an Architecture Board, but rather a part of the Architecture Governance Framework4.
    Option C is incorrect, because creating the Statement of Architecture Work is not a direct responsibility of an Architecture Board, but rather a part of the Architecture Development Method5.

6. Which of the following describes a purpose of Architecture Principles? 
- ***To establish a common understanding of how to control the business in pursuit of strategic objectives***
    - Exp: Architecture Principles are general rules and guidelines that inform and support the way in which an organization sets about fulfilling its mission. They reflect a level of consensus among the various elements of the enterprise, and form the basis for making future IT decisions. One of the purposes of Architecture Principles is to establish a common understanding of how to control the business in pursuit of strategic objectives, by providing a framework for evaluating and agreeing on the changes that affect the enterprise's architecture3

- 1F-2F-3E-4G

29. Consider the following chart:
<img src="/assets/prac-togaf-03.png" alt="TOGAF">

- ***ADM phases must be run in a sequenced approach to produce the Architecture.***
    - Exp: The chart shown is a Gantt chart, which is commonly used for project management to illustrate a project schedule. In the context of TOGAF (The Open Group Architecture Framework), which is a framework for enterprise architecture, this Gantt chart is demonstrating the sequenced approach to the Architecture Development Method (ADM). The ADM is the core process of TOGAF which provides a tested and repeatable process for developing architectures. The ADM is described as being iterative, over the whole process, between phases, and within phases. For each iteration of the ADM, a fresh decision must be taken about each of the parameters (scope, granularity, time period, and architecture assets).

    The ADM consists of a number of phases that have to be followed in sequence:

    Preliminary Phase: Framework and principles
    Phase A: Architecture Vision
    Phase B: Business Architecture
    Phase C: Information Systems Architectures, including Data and Application Architectures
    Phase D: Technology Architecture
    Phase E: Opportunities and Solutions
    Phase F: Migration Planning
    Phase G: Implementation Governance
    Phase H: Architecture Change Management
    Requirements Management

    Each phase is dependent on the outputs of the previous phase and the Requirements Management phase runs throughout. The Gantt chart clearly shows the dependency and sequence in which these phases occur, implying that a structured approach is followed to produce the enterprise architecture.

30. Consider the following ADM phases objectives.
<img src="/assets/prac-togaf-04.png" alt="TOGAF">

-  ***1C-2B-3A-4C***
    - Exp: The ADM consists of nine phases, each with a specific purpose and output. The phases are1:

    o Preliminary Phase: To prepare and initiate the architecture development cycle, including defining the architecture framework, principles, and governance.

    o Phase A: Architecture Vision: To define the scope, vision, and stakeholders of the architecture initiative, and to obtain approval to proceed.

    o Phase B: Business Architecture: To describe the baseline and target business architecture, and to identify the gaps between them.

    o Phase C: Information Systems Architectures: To describe the baseline and target data and application architectures, and to identify the gaps between them.

    o Phase D: Technology Architecture: To describe the baseline and target technology architecture, and to identify the gaps between them.

    o Phase E: Opportunities and Solutions: To identify and evaluate the opportunities and solutions for implementing the target architecture, and to define the work packages and transition architectures.

    o Phase F: Migration Planning: To finalize the implementation and migration plan, and to ensure alignment with the enterprise portfolio and project management.

    o Phase G: Implementation Governance: To provide architecture oversight and guidance for the implementation projects, and to manage any architecture change requests.

    o Phase H: Architecture Change Management: To monitor the changes in the business and technology environment, and to assess the impact and performance of the architecture.

    Based on the above definitions, we can match each objective with the corresponding phase as follows:

    o Objective 1: Develop the Target Data Architecture that enables the Business Architecture and the Architecture Vision. This objective is achieved in Phase
    C: Information Systems Architectures, where the data architecture is defined as a subset of the information systems architecture2. o Objective 2: Develop the Target Business Architecture that describes how the enterprise needs to operate to achieve the business goals. This objective is achieved in Phase B: Business Architecture, where the business architecture is defined as a subset of the enterprise architecture3. o Objective 3: Develop a high-level aspirational vision of the capabilities and business value to be delivered as a result of the proposed Enterprise Architecture. This objective is achieved in Phase A: Architecture Vision, where the architecture vision is defined as a high-level description of the target architecture and its benefits4.

    o Objective 4: Develop the Target Application Architecture that enables the Business Architecture and the Architecture Vision, in a way that addresses the Statement of Architecture Work and stakeholder concerns. This objective is achieved in Phase C: Information Systems Architectures, where the application architecture is defined as a subset of the information systems architecture2.

31.  Whatis presented as ”striking a balance between positive and negative outcomes resulting from the
 realization of either opportunities or threats?
 -  ***Risk Management***
    - Explanation: Risk Management is the process of identifying, assessing, and responding to risks that may affect the
 achievement of the enterprise’s objectives. Risk Management involves balancing positive and
 negative outcomes resulting from the realization of either opportunities or threats. Reference: The
 TOGAF® Standard | The Open Group Website, Section 3.3.3 Risk Management

32. Which of the following are the four purposes that typically frame the planning horizon, depth and
 breadth of an Architecture Project, and the contents of the EA Repository-?
- ***Strategy Portfolio Project Solution Delivery***
    - Explanation: Strategy Portfolio Project Solution Delivery are the four purposes that typically frame the planning
 horizon, depth and breadth of an Architecture Project, and the contents of the EA Repository. They
 correspond to different levels of abstraction and granularity in the architecture development
 process. Reference: The TOGAF® Standard, Version 9.2- The Open Group, Section 2.4 Architecture
 Repository.

33. Business Transformation Readiness Assessment is_________________
- ***a joint effort between corporate staff lines of business and IT planners***
    - Explanation: Business Transformation Readiness Assessment is a joint effort between corporate staff lines of
 business and IT planners to evaluate the readiness of the organization to undergo change. It involves
 assessing factors such as vision, commitment, capacity, capability, culture, and motivation that may
 influence the success of a business transformation initiative. Reference: The TOGAF® Standard | The
 Open Group Website, Section 3.3.2 Business Transformation Readiness Assessment.


34. The TOGAF standard covers the development of four architecture domains.
 Business. Data, Technology and__________________.
- ***Application***
    - Explanation: The TOGAFstandard covers the development of four architecture domains: Business, Data,
 Technology and Application. These domains represent different aspects of an enterprise’s
 architecture and provide a consistent way of describing, analyzing, and designing them. Reference:
 The TOGAF®Standard | The Open Group Website, Section 2.2 Architecture Development Method
 (ADM)

35. What is present in all phases within the ADM and should be identified, classified and mitigated before starting a transformation effort?
- ***Risk***
    - Explanation: According to the TOGAF Standard, 10th Edition, risk is present in all phases within the Architecture Development Method (ADM), and it should be identified, classified, and mitigated before starting a transformation effort 1. Risk is defined as ''the effect of uncertainty on objectives'' 2, and it can have positive or negative impacts on the architecture project. Risk management is a technique that helps to assess and address the potential risks that may affect the achievement of the architecture objectives, and to balance the trade-offs between opportunities and threats. Risk management is applied throughout the ADM cycle, from the Preliminary Phase to the Requirements Management Phase, and it is integrated with other techniques, such as stakeholder management, business transformation readiness assessment, gap analysis, and migration planning 1. The other options are not correct, as they are not present in all phases within the ADM, and they are not necessarily identified, classified, and mitigated before starting a transformation effort. Budgetary constraints are the limitations on the financial resources available for the architecture project, and they are usually considered in Phase E: Opportunities and Solutions, and Phase F: Migration Planning 3. Schedule constraints are the limitations on the time available for the architecture project, and they are also usually considered in Phase E and F 3. Information gaps are the missing or incomplete data or knowledge that may affect the architecture project, and they are usually identified in Phase B: Business Architecture, Phase C: Information Systems Architecture, and Phase D: Technology Architecture . Reference: 1: TOGAF Standard, 10th Edition, Part III: ADM Guidelines and Techniques, Chapter 32: Risk Management. 2: TOGAF Standard, 10th Edition, Part I: Introduction, Chapter 3: Definitions. 3: TOGAF Standard, 10th Edition, Part II: Architecture Development Method, Chapter 16: Phase E: Opportunities and Solutions, and Chapter 17: Phase F: Migration Planning. : TOGAF Standard, 10th Edition, Part II: Architecture Development Method, Chapter 13: Phase B: Business Architecture, Chapter 14: Phase C: Information Systems Architecture, and Chapter 15: Phase D: Technology Architecture.

36. In which phase(s) of the ADM would you deal with the actions resulting from a transformation readiness assessment?
- ***Phase E and F***
    - Explanation: According to the TOGAF Standard, 10th Edition, a transformation readiness assessment is a technique that evaluates the preparedness of the organization to undergo a change, and identifies the actions needed to increase the likelihood of a successful outcome. A transformation readiness assessment can be conducted in Phase E: Opportunities and Solutions, and the actions resulting from it can be dealt with in Phase F: Migration Planning 1. In Phase E, the transformation readiness assessment can help to identify the major implementation challenges and risks, and to define the critical success factors and key performance indicators for the architecture project. In Phase F, the actions resulting from the transformation readiness assessment can help to develop a detailed and realistic migration plan, and to address the gaps, issues, and dependencies that may affect the transition to the target architecture 1. Reference: 1: TOGAF Standard, 10th Edition, Part III: ADM Guidelines and Techniques, Chapter 29: Business Transformation Readiness Assessment.


37. Which section of the TOGAF template for Architecture Principles should highlight the business benefits of adhering to the principle?
- ***Rationale***
    - Explanation: According to the TOGAF Standard, 10th Edition, the rationale section of the architecture principles template should highlight the business benefits of adhering to the principle, as well as the business risks of not adhering to it 1. The rationale section should explain the reasoning behind the principle, and provide evidence or arguments to support it. The rationale section should also link the principle to the business drivers, goals, and objectives of the enterprise, and show how the principle contributes to the value and success of the enterprise. The other options are not correct, as they have different purposes in the architecture principles template. The name section should provide a short and memorable name for the principle, such as ''Information is an Asset'' or ''Business Continuity'' 1. The statement section should provide a concise and formal statement of the principle, such as ''The enterprise's information is recognized as a core asset, and is managed accordingly'' or ''The enterprise's ability to provide critical services and products must be maintained in the event of a disaster'' 1. The implications section should identify the impact of the principle on the enterprise, such as the changes, costs, benefits, and risks that may result from applying or violating the principle 1. Reference: 1: TOGAF Standard, 10th Edition, Part III: ADM Guidelines and Techniques, Chapter 23: Architecture Principles, Section 23.3 Developing Architecture Principles.


38. Consider the illustration.
<img src="/assets/prac-togaf-05.png" alt="TOGAF">

- ***A-Enterprise Continuum, B-Architecture Continuum, C-Solutions Continuum***
    - Explanation: The illustration shows the relationship between the Enterprise Continuum, the Architecture Continuum, and the Solutions Continuum, which are key concepts in the TOGAF framework. The Enterprise Continuum is a view of the Architecture Repository that shows how generic foundation architectures can be leveraged and specialized to support the requirements of an individual organization. The Architecture Continuum specifies a structured classification for architectural artifacts, such as models, patterns, and descriptions, that can be reused and adapted across different domains and levels of abstraction. The Solutions Continuum identifies implemented solutions that support various stages of business and IT capability evolution, such as common systems, industry solutions, and organization-specific solutions. The illustration also shows how the architecture context and requirements are influenced by external factors, such as business drivers, stakeholders, and standards, and how they shape the generic and specific architectures and solutions. The illustration also shows how the deployed solutions become part of the architecture context for future iterations of the architecture development cycle. Reference:

    * TOGAF Standard, 10th Edition, Part II: Architecture Development Method, Chapter 6: Architecture Repository, Section 6.2 Enterprise Continuum.

    * TOGAF Standard, 10th Edition, Part IV: Architecture Content Framework, Chapter 35: Enterprise Continuum and Tools, Section 35.1 Introduction.


40. When considering the scope of an architecture, what dimension considers to what level of detail the architecting effort should go?
- ***Depth***
    - Explanation: The scope of an architecture is the extent and level of detail of the architecture work. The scope of an architecture can be defined along four dimensions: project, breadth, depth, and architecture domains. The project dimension considers the boundaries and objectives of the architecture project, such as the time frame, budget, resources, and deliverables. The breadth dimension considers the coverage and completeness of the architecture across the enterprise, such as the organizational units, business functions, processes, and locations. The depth dimension considers the level of detail and specificity of the architecture, such as the granularity, abstraction, and precision of the architectural elements and relationships. The architecture domains dimension considers the aspects or segments of the architecture, such as the business, data, application, and technology domains.

    Therefore, the depth dimension is the one that considers to what level of detail the architecting effort should go.

41. Which ADM phase focuses on defining the problem to be solved, identifying the stakeholders, their concerns, and requirements?
- ***Phase A***
    - Explanation: Phase A: Architecture Vision is the first phase of the Architecture Development Method (ADM) cycle, which is the core of the TOGAF standard. The main purpose of this phase is to define the scope and approach of the architecture development, and to create the Architecture Vision, which is a high-level description of the desired outcomes and benefits of the proposed architecture. To achieve this purpose, this phase focuses on defining the problem to be solved, identifying the stakeholders, their concerns, and requirements, and establishing the business goals and drivers that motivate the architecture work. This phase also involves obtaining the approval and commitment of the sponsors and other key stakeholders, and initiating the Architecture Governance process.


-------
42. Which of the following are interests important to the stakeholders in a system?
- ***Concerns***
    - Explanation: Concerns are interests important to the stakeholders in a system. They are used to identify and classify the system's stakeholders and to guide the selection of viewpoints for the architecture description.

43. In which part of the ADM cycle do building block gaps become associated with work packages that will address the gaps?
- ***Phase E***
    - Explanation: In Phase E of the ADM cycle, building block gaps become associated with work packages that will address the gaps. This phase involves creating an Implementation and Migration Plan that defines a set of work packages and Transition Architectures that will deliver the Target Architecture.

44. Presenting different_________and_________to stakeholders helps architects to extract hidden agendas principles and requirements that could impact the final Target Architecture
- ***Architecture Views - Architecture Viewpoints ***
    - Explanation: According to the TOGAF Standard, an architecture view is a representation of a system from the perspective of a related set of concerns1. An architecture viewpoint is a specification of the conventions for a particular kind of architecture view1. Presenting different architecture views and architecture viewpoints to stakeholders helps architects to extract hidden agendas, principles, and requirements that could impact the final target architecture. This is because different stakeholders may have different concerns and interests in the system, and by showing them how the system addresses their concerns from different perspectives, the architects can elicit more feedback and validation from them2. For example, a business stakeholder may be interested in the business architecture view, which focuses on the business processes, functions, and capabilities of the system3. A security stakeholder may be interested in the enterprise security view, which addresses the security aspects of the system, such as confidentiality, integrity, and availability3. By presenting these views to the respective stakeholders, the architects can ensure that the system meets their expectations and needs, and also identify any potential issues or gaps that may affect the target architecture.

45. The purpose of the Preliminary Phase is to_____________.
- ***architect an Enterprise Architecture Capability***
    - Explanation: The purpose of the Preliminary Phase is to architect an Enterprise Architecture Capability that meets the needs and expectations of the enterprise's stakeholders and supports and enables subsequent phases of architecture development and transition. This phase involves defining the scope, principles, framework, and governance for the Enterprise Architecture Capability.

46. What provides context for architecture work, by describing the needs and ways of working employed by the enterprise?
- ***Business Principles, Business goals, and business drivers***
    - Explanation: Business principles business goals, and business drivers provide context for architecture work, by describing the needs and ways of working employed by the enterprise. They define what the enterprise wants to achieve, how it wants to operate, and what factors influence its decisions and actions.



47. Consider the following statement:

According to the TOGAF Standard a governed approach of a particular deliverable will ensure a system of continuous monitoring to check integrity changes decision-making and audit of all architecture-related activities

Which deliverable is being referred to?

- ***Architecture Contract***
    - Explanation: An Architecture Contract is a deliverable that specifies the responsibilities and obligations of the parties involved in the implementation and governance of an architecture. It ensures a system of continuous monitoring to check integrity changes decision-making and audit of all architecture-related activities.



48. A business scenario describes______________
-  ***business and technology environment in which those problems occur.***
    - Exp: A business scenario describes business and technology environment in which those problems occur. It provides a realistic context for identifying and addressing business problems and opportunities, as well as their impact on the enterprise's architecture.


49. Refer to the table below:
<img src="/assets/prac-togaf-06.jpeg" alt="TOGAF">

- ***Phase B***
    - Exp: Phase B of the ADM cycle is the Business Architecture phase. It describes the development of a Business Architecture to support an agreed Architecture Vision. The objectives of this phase are to describe the baseline and target Business Architecture, identify candidate Architecture Roadmap components based on gaps between the baseline and target, and determine whether an incremental approach is required.


50. Consider the following ADM phases objectives.
<img src="/assets/prac-togaf-07.jpeg" alt="TOGAF">

- 1H-2F-3F-4G
    - Explanation: According to the TOGAF Standard, Version 9.2, the ADM phases and their objectives are as follows1:

    o Preliminary Phase: To prepare and initiate the architecture development cycle, including defining the architecture framework, principles, and governance.

    o Phase A: Architecture Vision: To define the scope, vision, and stakeholders of the architecture initiative, and to obtain approval to proceed.

    o Phase B: Business Architecture: To describe the baseline and target business architecture, and to identify the gaps between them.

    o Phase C: Information Systems Architectures: To describe the baseline and target data and application architectures, and to identify the gaps between them.

    o Phase D: Technology Architecture: To describe the baseline and target technology architecture, and to identify the gaps between them.

    o Phase E: Opportunities and Solutions: To identify and evaluate the opportunities and solutions for implementing the target architecture, and to define the work packages and transition architectures.

    o Phase F: Migration Planning: To finalize the implementation and migration plan, and to ensure alignment with the enterprise portfolio and project management.

    o Phase G: Implementation Governance: To provide architecture oversight and guidance for the implementation projects, and to manage any architecture change requests.

    o Phase H: Architecture Change Management: To monitor the changes in the business and technology environment, and to assess the impact and performance of the architecture.

    o Requirements Management: To manage the architecture requirements throughout the ADM cycle, and to ensure alignment with the business requirements.

    Based on the above definitions, we can match each objective with the corresponding phase as follows:

    o Objective 1: Ensure that the business value and cost of work packages and transition architectures is understood by key stakeholders. This objective is achieved in Phase H: Architecture Change Management, where the value realization and cost-benefit analysis of the architecture are performed2. 
    o Objective 2: Ensure conformance with the Target Architecture by implementation projects. This objective is achieved in Phase F: Migration Planning, where the conformance requirements and criteria for the implementation projects are defined3.
    o Objective 3:Ensure that the architecture development cycle is 
    maintained. This objective is achieved in Phase F: Migration Planning, where the architecture roadmap and iteration cycle are maintained3. 
    o Objective 4: Ensure that the Architecture Governance Framework is executed. This objective is achieved in Phase G: Implementation Governance, where the architecture governance processes and procedures are applied to the implementation projects4.

51. Which of the following is included as part of Architecture Governance?
- ***Ensuring compliance with internal and external standards and regulatory obligations***
    - Explanation: Ensuring compliance with internal and external standards and regulatory obligations is one of the activities included as part of Architecture Governance. Architecture Governance is the practice and orientation by which enterprise architectures and other architectures are managed and controlled at an enterprise-wide level. It involves establishing processes, roles, responsibilities, policies, and standards to ensure that architectures are aligned with the enterprise's strategy and objectives, and meet the quality and performance requirements.


52. The Enterprise Continuum provides methods for classifying architecture artifacts as they evolve from________________________.
    - ***generic architectures to Organization-Specific Architectures***
        - Explanation: The Enterprise Continuum provides methods for classifying architecture artifacts as they evolve from generic architectures to Organization-Specific Architectures. Generic architectures are architectures that have been developed for use across a wide range of enterprises with similar characteristics. They provide common models, functions, and services that can be reused and adapted for specific purposes. Organization-Specific Architectures are architectures that have been tailored to meet the needs and requirements of a particular enterprise or a major organizational unit within an enterprise. They reflect the unique vision, goals, culture, structure, processes, systems, and technologies of that enterprise or unit.


53. Which of the following statements about architecture partitioning are correct*?

1 Partitions are used to simplify the management of the Enterprise Architecture

2 Partitions are equivalent to architecture levels

3 Partitions enable different teams to work on different element of the architecture at the same time.

4 Partitions reflect the organization's structure


- ***1 & 3***
    - Explanation: Statements 1 and 3 about architecture partitioning are correct. Architecture partitioning is the technique of dividing an architecture into smaller and more manageable parts that can be developed, maintained, and governed independently. Partitions are used to simplify the management of the Enterprise Architecture and to enable different teams to work on different elements of the architecture at the same time. Partitions are not equivalent to architecture levels, which are different degrees of abstraction or detail in an architecture. Partitions do not necessarily reflect the organization's structure, which may change over time or differ from the architecture's scope and boundaries.


54. Which of the following supports the need to govern Enterprise Architecture?

- ***Best practice governance enables the organization to control value realization***
    - Explanation: This statement best supports the need to govern Enterprise Architecture. Best practice governance enables the organization to control value realization by ensuring that architectures are aligned with the enterprise's strategy and objectives, meet the quality and performance requirements, and deliver the expected benefits and outcomes. The Architecture Project does not mandate the governance of the target architecture, but rather follows the governance framework established by the enterprise. The TOGAF standard can be used without executive governance, but it is recommended that executive sponsorship and support are obtained for successful architecture development and transition. The Stakeholders preferences may go beyond the architecture project scope and need control, but this is not the primary reason for governing Enterprise Architecture.


55. Which section of the TOGAF template for Architecture Principles should describe the relationship to other principles?
- ***Rationale***
    - Exp: According to the TOGAF template for Architecture Principles, the Rationale section should describe the relationship to other principles, as well as the business benefits and the intentions of adhering to the principle. The Rationale section should use business terminology and point to the similarity of information and technology principles to the principles governing business operations. The Rationale section should also explain how the principle supports the achievement of the business objectives and key architecture drivers.


56. Which statement best describes iteration and the ADM?
- ***The ADM is iterative, over the whole process between phases and within phases***
    - Exp: This statement best describes iteration and the ADM. The ADM is iterative over the whole process between phases and within phases because it allows for feedback loops and refinements at any point in the architecture development and transition process. Iteration enables architects to address changing requirements, assumptions, constraints, and environments; to validate and improve architectures; to manage risks and issues; and to ensure stakeholder satisfaction and value realization.



57. What are the four dimensions used to scope an architecture?
- ***Breadth, Depth, Time Period, Architecture Domains***
    - Exp: The four dimensions used to scope an architecture are Breadth, Depth, Time Period, and Architecture Domains1, p. 8.
        Breadth refers to the extent of the enterprise covered by the architecture, which can range from a specific business unit to the entire organization1, p. 8. Depth refers to the level of detail and completeness of the architecture, which can vary depending on the purpose, scope, and stakeholders of the architecture1, p. 8. Time Period refers to the temporal aspects of the architecture, such as the current state, the target state, and the transition plan1, p. 8. Architecture Domains refers to the classification of the architecture into four domains: Business, Data, Application, and Technology1, p. 8.

        These four dimensions help define the scope and boundaries of the architecture and ensure that it meets the needs and expectations of the stakeholders.


58. Consider the following statement:

Separate projects may operate their own ADM cycles concurrently, with relationships between the different projects

What does it illustrate?

- ***Iteration***
    - Exp: The statement illustrates iteration and the ADM. Iteration is the technique of repeating a process or a phase with the aim of improving or refining the outcome. Iteration allows for feedback loops and adaptations at any point in the architecture development and transition process. Separate projects may operate their own ADM cycles concurrently, with relationships between the different projects, to address different aspects or levels of the architecture in an iterative manner.


59. Which of the following is the ability to develop use and sustain the architecture of a particular enterprise using architecture to govern change?
- ***AN EA Capability***
    - Exp: The ability to develop, use, and sustain the architecture of a particular enterprise using architecture to govern change is an EA Capability. An EA Capability is a set of skills, processes, roles, responsibilities, tools, and techniques that enable an enterprise to successfully develop and maintain its Enterprise Architecture and achieve its desired outcomes. An EA Capability is part of an enterprise's overall capability portfolio and should be aligned with its strategy and objectives.


60. A set of architecture principles that cover every situation perceived meets the recommended criteria of_______________
- ***completeness***
    - Exp: A set of architecture principles that cover every situation perceived meets the recommended criteria of completeness. Completeness is one of the six criteria that should be applied when developing or assessing architecture principles. Completeness means that there are no gaps or overlaps in the coverage of principles across all relevant aspects of the enterprise's architecture.


61. Which of the following best describes a purpose of the Gap Analysis technique?
- ***To identify missing functions***
    - Exp: Gap analysis is a technique that is used to validate an architecture by highlighting the shortfall between the Baseline Architecture and the Target Architecture. One of the purposes of gap analysis is to identify missing functions that are either deliberately omitted, accidentally left out, or not yet defined in the Target Architecture. Missing functions are marked as gaps that need to be filled by developing or procuring the building blocks.




62. Which of the following best describes the purpose of the Architecture Roadmap?
- ***It lists work packages on a timeline showing progress towards the Target Architecture***
    - Exp: The purpose of the Architecture Roadmap is to provide a high-level view of how the Baseline Architecture will transition to the Target Architecture over time. It lists work packages on a timeline showing progress towards the Target Architecture, as well as dependencies, risks, and benefits. The Architecture Roadmap forms part of the Implementation and Migration Plan and guides the execution of the architecture projects.


63. Consider the following descriptions of deliverables consumed and produced across the TOGAF ADM cycle.
<img src="/assets/prac-togaf-08.jpeg" alt="TOGAF">

- ***1 Architecture Principles - 2 Architecture Contracts - 3 Request for ArArchitecture Work - 4 Architecture Requirement Specification***


64. What should be put in place through organization structures, roles, responsibilities, skills and processes to carry out architectural activity effectively?
- ***an EA Capability***
    - Exp: An EA Capability is the ability of an organization to perform enterprise architecture effectively and efficiently. It involves establishing and maintaining the appropriate organization structures, roles, responsibilities, skills, processes, tools, and governance mechanisms to support the development and use of enterprise architecture. An EA Capability enables the organization to align its business and IT strategies, deliver value from its investments, manage change and complexity, and improve its performance and agility12


65. Actions arising from the Business Transformation Readiness Assessment technique should be incorporated in the
- ***Implementation and Migration Plan***
    - Exp: The Business Transformation Readiness Assessment technique is used to evaluate the readiness of the organization to undergo change and to identify the actions needed to increase the likelihood of a successful business transformation. These actions should be incorporated in the Implementation and Migration Plan, which is the detailed plan to transition from the Baseline Architecture to the Target Architecture. The Implementation and Migration Plan also includes the Transition Architectures, the Architecture Building Blocks, the Work Packages, the Implementation Governance Model, and the Architecture Contract12


66. Which one of the following classes of information within the Architecture Repository would typically contain a list of the applications in use within the enterprise?
- ***Architecture Landscape***
    - Exp: The Architecture Landscape is a class of information within the Architecture Repository that shows an architectural view of the building blocks that are in use within the organization today (the Baseline Architecture), as well as those that are planned for the future (the Target Architecture). The Architecture Landscape typically contains a list of the applications in use within the enterprise, along with their relationships and dependencies, as well as other relevant architectural information. The Architecture Landscape helps to identify opportunities for re-use, consolidation, or retirement of existing applications, as well as gaps or overlaps in the current or future architecture.


67. The_________________ensures that a project transitioning into implementation also smoothly transitions into appropriate Architecture Governance.
- ***Implementation Governance Model***
    - Exp: The Implementation Governance Model is a framework that defines the roles, responsibilities, processes, and standards for governing the implementation of the target architecture. It ensures that a project transitioning into implementation also smoothly transitions into appropriate Architecture Governance, which is the practice of ensuring compliance with the enterprise architecture and its principles, standards, and goals. The Implementation Governance Model is part of the Implementation and Migration Plan, which is the output of Phase F: Migration Planning of the Architecture Development Method (ADM)12
