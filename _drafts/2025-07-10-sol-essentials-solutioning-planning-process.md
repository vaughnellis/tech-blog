### Solutioning Planning Process
- Refers to the set of activities that take place during the pre-sales opp phase.
- an iterative process

Solution Planning encompassess all of the `opp phase activities` that translate client req into a `well-defined solution` with a viable delivery approach


SA - responsible for `coordinating all efforts` across the Solution Planning process
- monitor, control, and report progress to the  Deal Owner, with focus on ensuring all aspects of quality and risk associated with the solution are effectively managed.


## Core Stages:

Stage 1:
- `Initialize and Prepare`
    - `Review` all available info to understand req and desired business outcome
    - `Mobilize` pursuit team req to support dev of the solution
    - `Define` core scope, approach, and timelines for all Solution Planning activities

Stage 2:
- `Develop the Solution Plan` - iterative process
    - `Confirm` what req's are in and out of scope for the solution
    - `Assess` Client and Avanade capabilities and constraints
    - `Develop`  the business process, change enablement, application, technology, and security blueprints, as applicable. 
                 Incorporating appropriate use of offerings, assets, and other enablers for industrialized delivery.
    - `Define` the elements of the solution delivery strategy and mobilization approach
    - `Develop` effort estimation, incorp. release and staffing plans, create the cost estimate
    - `Define` distributed working approach and ensure Delivery Center Support Obtained (DCSO) agreement for offshore ATC solutions
    - `Seek continual feedback` from both Avanade and Client stakeholders throughout the process

Stage 3:
- `Validate and Transition` - conclude the solution planning process
    - `Document the solution` in the Solution Plan template (SP051 or ETA) and validate for consistency and completeness
    - `Obtain approval` as part of the Solution Review process
    - `Support` the contracting phase
    - `Manage transition` of the solution to the delivery team


## Initialize and prepare

Form the core team that will support the development of the solution and equip them with the relevant info and framework to be successful

- Review opp inputs
    - Request a sales briefing from the Deal Owner and `check you have all available information`
    - `Assess the quality and accuracy` of all available info as this will form the basis for all subsequent Solution Planning work products.
    - Make sure you are introduced to the `key Client contacts`
    - Quickly identify any required `SMEs` needed to support creation of the solution

    Expert tip: seeking to understand all aspects of the opp that affet the scope of the solution

- Confirm stakeholder expectations
    - Capture the expectations of both `internal and external stakeholders` and establish any conflicts.
    - Use the Deal Owner to `reconfirm Client expectations, success measures, and key Client dependencies` with the Client to verify understanding and reconcile any conflicting expectations.

    Expert tip: MOdify expectations over the course of solution development, especially when addtl Client stakeholders or info is involved.


- Create the plan for developing solution / Roadmap for Solution Planning Work
    - Define the overall `schedule, milestions, resources, and budget` for the Solution Planning effort.
    - Create a `task list and timeline` for meetings, proposals, solution artefacts, etc.
    - Identify the `resources and specialty skills` required to mobilize and execute the Solution Planning effort.
    - Understand the Avanade and Client `governance requirements` supporting the sales pursuit.

    Expert tip: include the `Plan for the Plan` slide in the SP051 template

- Obtain resources and orient the team
    - Clearly define the `roles nad responsibilities` for each team member
    - Ensure the team has all the `required resources` to carry out their activities

    Expert Tip: Required members in Solution Planning team: Solution Arch, Offerling Lead, QA Director (QAD), tech/business/application arch, other admin resources



## Develop the Solution Plan

- Confirm the scope
    - Defining the scope is `highly iterative` with changes likely occurring throughout the solutioning process
    - `Understand the Clients business values` and `desired business outcomes` in relation to the opp and the values that Avanade can bring to the table
    - Involve `Offering Leads` and `seek guidance` from other Solution Architects.
    - Consider the use of `Avanade assets`, `accelerators` and `industrialized solutions`.


- Assess capabilities and constraints 
    - Evaluate the Client's current IT, infra, and business capabilities and any constraints the Client is imposing on the solution
        - People
            - Resources (number, skills, experience) required to participate in solution delivery; Avanade, Client, and/or 3rd Party
        - Business Processes
            - The current business process models
        - Technology
            - The current IT infra in addition to legacy systems and env. Volume and state of data to be converted and processed.
        - Interfacing systems
            - technical platform and its degree of adaptability
        - Business drivers
            - Systems may have a hard go-live date to meet legal or other business needs/other constraints on the solution.
        - Culture
            - History of the Client in progream delivery, particularly with offshoring. Relative impt. of training, strong financial business case, etc.


- Define solution blueprint
    - Goal is to obtain an understanding of the req business functions and identify relevant reference arch and tech patterns that can be reused for designing the solution.

    - Business process
        - Req when the business process is changing significantly to understand the as-is and to-be situation of relevant scope, arch, and scenarios.
    - Change enablement
        - Dependent on the magnitude of the change produced by the new solution, to define the change initiatives that will be needed to enable people to perform in the new env.
    - Application architecture
        - Identifies the solution components req to meet the stated business capabilities and goals and the relationship between them
    - Technology architecture
        - Describes a vision of the tech arch that will support the business apps
    - Security architecture
        - Describes how the solution meets the necessary legal, regulatory, Client, and Avanade policies related to info security.


- Define delivery strategy and mobilization approach - HOW ava will deliver the solution
    -  Sufficient detail to estaimte the cost, effort, timeline to deliver the solution
    - `Critical decisions` regarding delivery approach, sourcing, procurement, transition, piloting or prototyping, testing, and deployment of the entire solution (multiple proj and multiple releases, as appropriate) are `documented` in delivery strategy.
    - Important to consider the approach against `Client Data Protection (CDP)` and any other compliance risks e.g. Export Compliance, Industry req etc.

    Key Factors to consider:
    1. Complexity and type of work
    2. Expected size and duration of engagement
    3. Release plan, dependencies and expectations
    4. Availability and location of required resources
    5. Workforce guidelines and experience expectations
    6. Delivery approaches (traditional vs iterative vs agile)
    7. Client process maturity experience
    8. Client expectations on cultural diversity or alignment
    9. Alliances and third-parties dependencies



- Plan and estimate solution
    - Estimation is an iterative process between the `effort estimate`, `release plan`, and `staffing plan` before we arrive at the right solution.
    - The cost estimate `assists the Deal Owner in formulating a price to offer the Client` for the proposed Solution.


- Obtain Delivery Center support
    - Goal is to confirm that the output of the Define Delivery Strategy activity can be met by the target ATC org capabilities

    Steps to Obtain DC Support:
    1. Engage ATC
        - Contact early in the Solution Planning process with an ATC Solution Arch assigned to define the solution strategy, planning, and estimation.
        - There should be open discussion between the onshore and offshore Solution Arch about the skills, capability, and scope that a Tech Center can effectively deliver - as well as any risks that should be considered as part of the deal shaping

    2. Obtain Delivery Center Support Obtained (DCSO) Agreement Approval
        - outlines the work expected to be done by the ATC, incl. shaping solution shape, staffing, pyramids, skills req, estimates, staffing lead times, and infra req, and includes ATC delivery risks.


### Recap - Develop the Solution Plan

Activity | Description
Confirm Scope | Focus on  defining objectives, expectations, and requirements for the solution.
Assess Capabilities and Constraints | Understand the current state of Client's business processes, applications, system, etc.
Define Solution Blueprint | Create vision of the to-be state of the environment for the scope of the work.
Define Delivery Strategy | Document an overall view of HOW Avanade will deliver the solution.
Plan and Estimate Solution | Create effort and cost estimation for the solution.
Obtain Delivery Center Support | Confirm ATC Components and Obtain DCSO Agreement Approval



## Validate and transition
Goal is to create a Solution Plan presentation d eck that appropriately reflects all of the components of the Solution in a manner that can be won and delivered.

1.  `Quality Assurance` process must be followed prior to the Solution review to make sure the risks are appropriately identified, mitigated, and an associated risk-based solution contingency is assigned
2. `Review the final Solution Plan` with internal stakeholders to ensure agreement to the solution.
3. SA will `provide input to the contract`, and further refinement of the solution may be req based on Client nego
4. When the deal is won, the SA and Deal Owner  will work with the Delivery team to `transition all knowledge` of the Solution Plan as part of the Mobilization effort.



## Summary

The success of a project depends, to a large extent, on the success of the Solution Planning process.

Stages | Recap
Initialize and Prepare | Source, manage, and mobilize any req resources and infra to succeed in developing the Solution Plan
Develop the Solution | SA is responsible for coordinating efforts across all Solution Planning activities and manage quality and risk. (Confirm Scope > Assess Capabilities and Constraints > Define Solution Blueprint > Define Delivery Strategy > Plan and Estimate Solution > Obtain Delivery Center Support (DCSO))
Validate and Transition | Create the Solution Plan presentation deck, review the final Solution Plan w/ relevant stakeholders, and e nsure that all knowledge is transitioned to the appropriate delivery stakeholders as part of mobilization.
