App does the tedious number-crunching so you don't have to.

3. Lots of bug fixes! ðŸ˜…

## Whatâ€™s cookinâ€™

I started this passion project with the though process of building an MVP.
The objective was to see if this would help me and in the hopes of helping others as well.

Now that I have added a bunch of features, it has been challenging for me to manage since I have designed this as a ***thin backend*** with a ***smart client***.

To summarize:

I have the ff:
- React/Electron/Cordova/Capacitor doing **ALL** the heavy lifting on the frontend
- Azure Logic app basically just playing CRUD middleman
- Azure Cosmos DB storing everything
- ALL business logic living in the client ðŸ˜†

This means I still have the same 4 operations and all business logic resides within the client(omg!ðŸ˜…)

The good news? It works! The less good news? Every new feature feels like I'm playing architectural Jenga. 
Which is why I'm now in the planning stage to modernize the architecture.


## What's next

I'm about to make some big moves!

I want to try something completely different this time.
Once I've got the technical foundation sorted, I'll phone a UI/UX designer magician friend.
When everything is said and done, the scary and exciting part is having a select few perform beta testing!

The dream is to get this onto the Google Play Store and Apple store and actually help people manage their finances better.

If you have any comments/suggestion/recommendation/any feedback, please feel to reach out!
